// The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Windows specific system characteristic items found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each item is an extension of the standard item element defined in the Core System Characteristic Schema. Through extension, each item inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL Items. Each item is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core System Characteristic Schema is not outlined here.

// AccesstokenItem: The access token item holds information about the individual privileges and rights associated with a specific access token. It is important to note that these privileges are specific to certain versions of Windows. As a result, the documentation for that version of Windows should be consulted for more information. Each privilege and right in the data section accepts a boolean value signifying whether the privilege is granted or not. It extends the standard ItemType as defined in the oval-system-characteristics schema and one should refer to the ItemType description for more information.

	// SecurityPrinciple: Security principles include users or groups with either local or domain accounts, and computer accounts created when a computer joins a domain. In Windows, security principles are case-insensitive. As a result, it is recommended that the case-insensitive operations are used for this entity. User rights and permissions to access objects such as Active Directory objects, files, and registry settings are assigned to security principles. In a domain environment, security principles should be identified in the form: "domain\trustee name". For local security principles use: "computer name\trustee name". For built-in accounts on the system, use the trustee name without a domain.
