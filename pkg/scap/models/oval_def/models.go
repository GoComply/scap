// The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the core schema for encoding Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) Definitions. Some of the objects defined here are extended and enhanced by individual component schemas, which are described in separate documents. Each of the elements, types, and attributes that make up the Core Definition Schema are described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between these objects is not outlined here.

// OvalDefinitions: The oval_definitions element is the root of an OVAL Definition Document. Its purpose is to bind together the major sections of a document - generator, definitions, tests, objects, states, and variables - which are the children of the root element.
type OvalDefinitions struct {
	XMLName xml.Name `xml:"oval_definitions"`

	// Generator: The required generator section provides information about when the definition file was compiled and under what version.

	States *StatesType `xml:"states"`

	// Variables: The optional variables section contains 1 or more variables.
	Variables *VariablesType `xml:"variables"`

	// Signature: The optional Signature element allows an XML Signature as defined by the W3C to be attached to the document. This allows authentication and data integrity to be provided to the user. Enveloped signatures are supported. More information about the official W3C Recommendation regarding XML digital signatures can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/.

An OVAL Test is used to compare an object(s) against a defined state. An actual test element is not valid. The use of this abstract class simplifies the OVAL schema by allowing individual tests to inherit the optional notes child element, and the id and comment attributes from the base TestType. Please refer to the description of the TestType complex type for more information.

// Set: The set element enables complex objects to be described. It is a recursive element in that each set element can contain additional set elements as children. Each set element defines characteristics that produce a matching unique set of items. This set of items is defined by one or two references to OVAL Objects that provide the criteria needed to collect a set of system items. These items can have one or more filters applied to allow a subset of those items to be specifically included or excluded from the overall set of items.

}

// Variable: The variable element is an abstract element that is meant to be extended (via substitution groups) by the different types of variables. An actual variable element is not valid. The different variable types describe different sources for obtaining a value(s) for the variable. There are currently three types of variables; local, external, and constant. Please refer to the description of each one for more specific information. The value(s) of a variable is treated as if it were inserted where referenced. One of the main benefits of variables is that they allow tests to evaluate user-defined policy. For example, an OVAL Test might check to see if a password is at least a certain number of characters long, but this number depends upon the individual policy of the user. To solve this, the test for password length can be written to refer to a variable element that defines the length.
type Variable struct {
	XMLName xml.Name `xml:"variable"`

// ExternalVariable: The external_variable element extends the VariableType and defines a variable with some external source. The actual value(s) for the variable is not provided within the OVAL file, but rather it is retrieved during the evaluation of the OVAL Definition from an external source. An unbounded set of possible-value and possible_restriction child elements can be specified that together specify the list of all possible values that an external source is allowed to supply for the external variable. In other words, the value assigned by an external source must match one of the possible_value or possible_restriction elements specified. Each possible_value element contains a single value that could be assigned to the given external_variable while each possible_restriction element outlines a range of possible values. Note that it is not necessary to declare a variable's possible values, but the option is available if desired. If no possible child elements are specified, then the valid values are only bound to the specified datatype of the external variable. Please refer to the description of the PossibleValueType and PossibleRestrictionType complex types for more information.

// ConstantVariable: The constant_variable element extends the VariableType and defines a variable with a constant value(s). Each constant_variable defines either a single value or a collection of values to be used throughout the evaluation of the OVAL Definition File in which it has been defined. Constant variables cannot be over-ridden by an external source. The actual value of a constant variable is defined by the required value child element. A collection of values can be specified by including multiple instances of the value element. Please refer to the description of the ValueType complex type for more information.

// LocalVariable: The local_variable element extends the VariableType and defines a variable with some local source. The actual value(s) for the variable is not provided in the OVAL Definition document but rather it is retrieved during the evaluation of the OVAL Definition. Each local variable is defined by either a single component or a complex function, meaning that a value can be as simple as a literal string or as complex as multiple registry keys concatenated together. Note that if an individual component is used and it returns a collection of values, then there will be multiple values associated with the local_variable. For example, if an object_component is used and it references a file object that identifies a set of 5 files, then the local variable would evaluate to a collection of those 5 values. Please refer to the description of the ComponentGroup for more information.

type DefinitionsType struct {

	Definition []DefinitionType `xml:",any"`
}

// DefinitionType: The DefinitionType defines a single OVAL Definition. A definition is the key structure in OVAL. It is analogous to the logical sentence or proposition: if a computer's state matches the configuration parameters laid out in the criteria, then that computer exhibits the state described. The DefinitionType contains a section for various metadata related elements that describe the definition. This includes a description, version, affected system types, and reference information. The notes section of a definition should be used to hold information that might be helpful to someone examining the technical aspects of the definition. For example, why certain tests have been included in the criteria, or maybe a link to where further information can be found. The DefinitionType also (unless the definition is deprecated) contains a criteria child element that joins individual tests together with a logical operator to specify the specific computer state being described.

The affected metadata item contains information about the system(s) for which the definition has been written. Remember that this is just metadata and not part of the criteria. Please refer to the AffectedType description for more information. The required description element contains a textual description of the configuration state being addressed by the OVAL Definition.

The family, platform(s), and product(s) of this target are described by the AffectedType whose main purpose is to provide hints for tools using OVAL Definitions. For instance, to help a reporting tool only use Windows definitions, or to preselect only Red Hat definitions to be evaluated. Note, the inclusion of a particular platform or product does not mean the definition is physically checking for the existence of the platform or product. For the actual test to be performed, the correct test must still be included in the definition's criteria section.

// ArithmeticFunctionType: The arithmetic function takes two or more integer or float components and performs a basic mathematical function on them. The result of this function is a single integer or float unless one of the components returns a collection of values. In this case the specified arithmetic function would be performed multiple times and the end result would also be a collection of values for the local variable. For example assume a local_variable specifies the arithmetic function with an arithmetic_operation of "add" and has two sub-components under this function: the first component returns "1" and "2", and the second component returns "3" and "4" and "5". The local_variable element would be evaluated to be a collection of six values: 1+3, 1+4, 1+5, 2+3, 2+4, and 2+5.
type ArithmeticFunctionType struct {

// BeginFunctionType: The begin function takes a single string component and defines a character (or string) that the component string should start with. The character attribute defines the specific character (or string). The character (or string) is only added to the component string if the component string does not already start with the specified character (or string). If the component string does not start with the specified character (or string) the entire character (or string) will be prepended to the component string..

// ConcatFunctionType: The concat function takes two or more components and concatenates them together to form a single string. The first component makes up the beginning of the resulting string and any following components are added to the end it. If one of the components returns multiple values then the concat function would be performed multiple times and the end result would be a collection of values for the local variable. For example assume a local variable has two sub-components: a basic component element returns the values "abc" and "def", and a literal component element that has a value of "xyz". The local_variable element would evaluate to a collection of two values, "abcxyz" and "defxyz". If one of the components does not exist, then the result of the concat operation should be does not exist.
type ConcatFunctionType struct {

// EndFunctionType: The end function takes a single string component and defines a character (or string) that the component string should end with. The character attribute defines the specific character (or string). The character (or string) is only added to the component string if the component string does not already end with the specified character (or string). If the desired end character is a string, then the entire end string must exist at the end if the component string. If the entire end string is not present then the entire end string is appended to the component string.
type EndFunctionType struct {

}

// EscapeRegexFunctionType: The escape_regex function takes a single string component and escapes all of the regular expression characters. If the string sub-component contains multiple values, then the escape_regex function will be applied to each individual value and return a multiple-valued result. For example, the string '(\.test_string*)?' will evaluate to '\(\\\.test_string\*\)\?'. The purpose for this is that many times, a component used in pattern match needs to be treated as a literal string and not a regular expression. For example, assume a basic component element that identifies a file path that is held in the Windows registry. This path is a string that might contain regular expression characters. These characters are likely not intended to be treated as regular expression characters and need to be escaped. This function allows a definition writer to mark convert the values of components to regular expression format.
type EscapeRegexFunctionType struct {
	XMLName xml.Name
}

// SplitFunctionType: The split function takes a single string component and turns it into a collection of values based on a delimiter string. For example, assume that a basic component element returns the value "a-b-c-d" to the split function with the delimiter set to "-". The local_variable element would be evaluated to have four values "a", "b", "c", and "d". If the basic component returns a value that begins, or ends, with a delimiter, the local_variable element would contain empty string values at the beginning, or end, of the collection of values returned for that string component. For example, if the delimiter is "-", and the basic component element returns the value "-a-a-", the local_variable element would evaluate to a collection of four values "", "a", "a", and "". Likewise, if the basic component element returns a value that contains adjacent delimiters such as "---", the local_variable element would evaluate to a collection of four values "", "", "", and "". Lastly, if the basic component element used by the split function returnsa collection of values, then the split function is performed multiple times, and all of the results, from each of the split functions, are returned.
type SplitFunctionType struct {
	XMLName xml.Name

	Delimiter string `xml:"delimiter,attr"`
}

// SubstringFunctionType: The substring function takes a single string component and produces a single value that contains a portion of the original string. The substring_start attribute defines the starting position in the original string. To include the first character of the string, the start position would be 1. A value less than 1 also means that the start position would be 1. If the substring_start attribute has value greater than the length of the original string an error should be reported. The substring_length attribute defines how many characters after, and including, the starting character to include. A substring_length value greater than the actual length of the string, or a negative value, means to include all of the characters after the starting character. For example, assume a basic component element that returns the value "abcdefg" with a substring_start value of 3 and a substring_length value of 2. The local_variable element would evaluate to have a single value of "cd". If the string component used by the substring function returns a collection of values, then the substring operation is performed multiple times and results in a collection of values for the component.
type SubstringFunctionType struct {
	XMLName xml.Name

	SubstringStart int `xml:"substring_start,attr"`

	SubstringLength int `xml:"substring_length,attr"`
}

// TimeDifferenceFunctionType: The time_difference function calculates the difference in seconds between date-time values. If one component is specified, the values of that component are subtracted from the current time (UTC). The current time is the time at which the function is evaluated. If two components are specified, the value of the second component is subtracted from the value of the first component. If the component(s) contain a collection of values, the operation is performed multiple times on the Cartesian product of the component(s) and the result is also a collection of time difference values. For example, assume a local_variable specifies the time_difference function and has two sub-components under this function: the first component returns "04/02/2009" and "04/03/2009", and the second component returns "02/02/2005" and "02/03/2005" and "02/04/2005". The local_variable element would evaluate to a collection of six values: (ToSeconds("04/02/2009") - ToSeconds("02/02/2005")), (ToSeconds("04/02/2009") - ToSeconds("02/03/2005")), (ToSeconds("04/02/2009") - ToSeconds("02/04/2005")), (ToSeconds("04/03/2009") - ToSeconds("02/02/2005")), (ToSeconds("04/03/2009") - ToSeconds("02/03/2005")), and (ToSeconds("04/03/2009") - ToSeconds("02/04/2005")).

// RegexCaptureFunctionType: The regex_capture function captures a single substring from a single string component. If the string sub-component contains multiple values, then the regex_capture function will extract a substring from each value. The 'pattern' attribute provides a regular expression that should contain a single subexpression (using parentheses). For example, the pattern ^abc(.*)xyz$ would capture a substring from each of the string component's values if the value starts with abc and ends with xyz. In this case the subexpression would be all the characters that exist in between the abc and the xyz. Note that subexpressions match the longest possible substrings.
type RegexCaptureFunctionType struct {
	XMLName xml.Name

	Pattern string `xml:"pattern,attr"`
}

// UniqueFunctionType: The unique function takes one or more components and removes any duplicate value from the set of components. All components used in the unique function will be treated as strings. For example, assume that three components exist, one that contains a string value of 'foo', and two of which both resolve to the string value 'bar'. Applying the unique function to these three components resolves to a local_variable with two string values, 'foo' and 'bar'. Additionally, if any of the components referenced by the unique function evaluate to a collection of values, then those values are used in the unique calculation. For example, assume that there are two components, one of which resolves to a single string value, 'foo', the other of which resolves to two string values, 'foo' and 'bar'. If the unique function is used to remove duplicates from these two components, the function will resolve to a local_variable that is a collection of two string values, 'foo' and 'bar'.
type UniqueFunctionType struct {
	XMLName xml.Name
}

// CountFunctionType: The count function takes one or more components and returns the count of all of the values represented by the components. For example, assume that two variables exist, each with a single value. By applying the count function against two variable components that resolve to the two variables, the resulting local_variable would have a value of '2'. Additionally, if any of the components referenced by the count function evaluate to a collection of values, then those values are used in the count calculation. For example, assume that there are two components, one of which resolves to a single value, the other of which resolves to two values. If the count function is used to provide a count of these two components, the function will resolve to a local_variable with the values '3'.
type CountFunctionType struct {
	XMLName xml.Name
}

// GlobToRegexFunctionType: The glob_to_regex function takes a single string component representing shell glob pattern and produces a single value that corresponds to result of a conversion of the original glob pattern into Perl 5's regular expression pattern. The glob_noescape attribute defines the way how the backslash ('\') character should be interpreted. It defaults to 'false' meaning backslash should be interpreted as an escape character (backslash is allowed to be used as an escape character). If the glob_noescape attribute would be set to 'true' it instructs the glob_to_regex function to interpret the backslash ('\') character as a literal, rather than as an escape character (backslash is *not* allowed to be used as an escape character). Refer to table with examples below to see the difference how a different boolean value of the 'glob_noescape' attribute will impact the output form of the resulting Perl 5's regular expression produced by glob_to_regex function.

Specifying a datatype defines how the less than operation should be performed. Another way of thinking of things is that the datatype attribute specifies how the data should be cast before performing the operation (note that the default datatype is 'string'). In the previous example, if the datatype is set to int, then '123' and '98' should be cast as integers. Another example is applying the 'equals' operation to '1.0.0.0' and '1.0'. With datatype 'string' they are not equal, with datatype 'version' they are. Note that there are certain cases where a cast from one datatype to another is not possible. If a cast cannot be made, (trying to cast 'abc' to an integer) then an error should be reported. For example, if the datatype is set to 'integer' and the value is the empty string.

Values MUST NOT be masked in OVAL System Characteristics documents that are not contained within an OVAL Results document.

As another example, if a state entity 'size' with an operation of 'less than' references a variable that has five different integer values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then the 'size' state entity evaluates to true only if the corresponding 'size' item entity is less than each of the five integers defined by the variable.

In this condition, there is no value of var_check which enables an element-wise comparison, and so there is no way to determine whether the two entities are truly 'equal' in that sense.

For example, if an object entity 'filename' with an operation of 'not equal' references a variable that returns five different values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then an actual file on the system matches only if the actual filename does not equal any of the variable values. As another example, if a state entity 'size' with an operation of 'less than' references a variable that has five different integer values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then the 'size' state entity evaluates to true only if the corresponding 'size' item entity is less than each of the five integers defined by the variable. If a variable does not have any value value when referenced by an OVAL Object the object should be considered to not exist. If a variable does not have any value when referenced by an OVAL State an error should be reported during OVAL analysis. When an OVAL State uses a var_ref, if both the state entity and a corresponding item entity are collections of values, the var_check is applied to each value of the item entity individually, and all must evaluate to true for the state entity to evaluate to true. In this condition, there is no value of var_check which enables an element-wise comparison, and so there is no way to determine whether the two entities are truly 'equal' in that sense.

	// Datatype: The optional datatype attribute specifies how the given operation should be applied to the data. Since we are dealing with XML everything is technically a string, but often the value is meant to represent some other datatype and this affects the way an operation is performed. For example, with the statement 'is 123 less than 98'. If the data is treated as integers the answer is no, but if the data is treated as strings, then the answer is yes. Specifying a datatype defines how the less than operation should be performed. Another way of thinking of things is that the datatype attribute specifies how the data should be cast before performing the operation (note that the default datatype is 'string'). In the previous example, if the datatype is set to int, then '123' and '98' should be cast as integers. Another example is applying the 'equals' operation to '1.0.0.0' and '1.0'. With datatype 'string' they are not equal, with datatype 'version' they are. Note that there are certain cases where a cast from one datatype to another is not possible. If a cast cannot be made, (trying to cast 'abc' to an integer) then an error should be reported. For example, if the datatype is set to 'integer' and the value is the empty string.
