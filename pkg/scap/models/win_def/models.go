// The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Windows specific tests found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each test is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

// AccesstokenTest: The accesstoken_test is used to check the properties of a Windows access token as well as individual privileges and rights associated with it. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references an accesstoken_object and the optional state element specifies the data to check.

// AccesstokenObject: The accesstoken_object element is used by an access token test to define the object to be evaluated. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

	// SecurityPrinciple: The security_principle element defines the access token being specified. Security principles include users or groups with either local or domain accounts, and computer accounts created when a computer joins a domain. In Windows, security principles are case-insensitive. As a result, it is recommended that the case-insensitive operations are used for this entity. User rights and permissions to access objects such as Active Directory objects, files, and registry settings are assigned to security principles. In a domain environment, security principles should be identified in the form: "domain\trustee name". For local security principles use: "computer name\trustee name". For built-in accounts on the system, use the trustee name without a domain. If an operation other than equals is used to identify matching trustees (i.e. not equal, or a pattern match) then the resulting matches shall be limited to only the trustees referenced in the Local Security Authority database. The scope is limited here to avoid unnecessarily resource intensive searches for trustees. Note that the larger scope of all known trustees may be obtained through the use of variables.

// AuditeventpolicysubcategoriesTest: The auditeventpolicysubcategories_test is used to check the audit event policy settings on a Windows system. These settings are used to specify which system and network events are monitored. For example, if the credential_validation element has a value of AUDIT_FAILURE, it means that the system is configured to log all unsuccessful attempts to validate a user account on a system. It is important to note that these audit event policy settings are specific to certain versions of Windows. As a result, the documentation for that version of Windows should be consulted for more information on each setting. The test extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a auditeventpolicy_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

// CmdletObject: The cmdlet_object element is used by a cmdlet_test to identify the set of cmdlets to use and the parameters to provide to them for checking the state of a system. In order to ensure the consistency of PowerShell cmdlet support among OVAL interpreters as well as ensure that the state of a system is not changed, every OVAL interpreter must implement the following requirements. An OVAL interpreter must only support the processing of the verbs specified in the EntityObjectCmdletVerbType. If a cmdlet verb that is not defined in this enumeration is discovered, an error should be reported and the cmdlet must not be executed on the system. While XML Schema validation will enforce this requirement, it is strongly recommended that OVAL interpreters implement a whitelist of allowed cmdlets. This can be done using constrained runspaces which can limit the PowerShell execution environment. For more information, please see Microsoft's documentation on Windows PowerShell Host Application Concepts. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that OVAL interpreters also implement PowerShell support with the NoLanguage mode enabled. The NoLanguage mode ensures that scripts that need to be evaluated are not allowed in the runspace. For more information about the NoLanguage mode, please see Microsoft's documentation on the PSLanguageMode enumeration.

Another way of thinking of things is that the datatype attribute specifies how the data should be cast before performing the operation (note that the default datatype is 'string'). In the previous example, if the datatype is set to int, then '123' and '98' should be cast as integers. Another example is applying the 'equals' operation to '1.0.0.0' and '1.0'. With datatype 'string' they are not equal, with datatype 'version' they are. Note that there are certain cases where a cast from one datatype to another is not possible.

Values MUST NOT be masked in OVAL System Characteristics documents that are not contained within an OVAL Results document.

If a variable does not have any value value when referenced by an OVAL Object the object should be considered to not exist. If a variable does not have any value when referenced by an OVAL State an error should be reported during OVAL analysis. When an OVAL State uses a var_ref, if both the state entity and a corresponding item entity are collections of values, the var_check is applied to each value of the item entity individually, and all must evaluate to true for the state entity to evaluate to true. In this condition, there is no value of var_check which enables an element-wise comparison, and so there is no way to determine whether the two entities are truly 'equal' in that sense.

	// Datatype: The optional datatype attribute specifies how the given operation should be applied to the data. Since we are dealing with XML everything is technically a string, but often the value is meant to represent some other datatype and this affects the way an operation is performed. For example, with the statement 'is 123 less than 98'. If the data is treated as integers the answer is no, but if the data is treated as strings, then the answer is yes. Specifying a datatype defines how the less than operation should be performed. Another way of thinking of things is that the datatype attribute specifies how the data should be cast before performing the operation (note that the default datatype is 'string'). In the previous example, if the datatype is set to int, then '123' and '98' should be cast as integers. Another example is applying the 'equals' operation to '1.0.0.0' and '1.0'. With datatype 'string' they are not equal, with datatype 'version' they are. Note that there are certain cases where a cast from one datatype to another is not possible. If a cast cannot be made, (trying to cast 'abc' to an integer) then an error should be reported. For example, if the datatype is set to 'integer' and the value is the empty string. There is no way to cast the empty string (or NULL) to an integer, and in cases like this an error should be reported.

As another example, if a state entity 'size' with an operation of 'less than' references a variable that has five different integer values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then the 'size' state entity evaluates to true only if the corresponding 'size' item entity is less than each of the five integers defined by the variable.

	// Datatype: The optional datatype attribute specifies how the given operation should be applied to the data. Since we are dealing with XML everything is technically a string, but often the value is meant to represent some other datatype and this affects the way an operation is performed. For example, with the statement 'is 123 less than 98'. If the data is treated as integers the answer is no, but if the data is treated as strings, then the answer is yes. Specifying a datatype defines how the less than operation should be performed. Another way of thinking of things is that the datatype attribute specifies how the data should be cast before performing the operation (note that the default datatype is 'string'). In the previous example, if the datatype is set to int, then '123' and '98' should be cast as integers. Another example is applying the 'equals' operation to '1.0.0.0' and '1.0'. With datatype 'string' they are not equal, with datatype 'version' they are. Note that there are certain cases where a cast from one datatype to another is not possible. If a cast cannot be made, (trying to cast 'abc' to an integer) then an error should be reported. For example, if the datatype is set to 'integer' and the value is the empty string. There is no way to cast the empty string (or NULL) to an integer, and in cases like this an error should be reported.

Values MUST NOT be masked in OVAL System Characteristics documents that are not contained within an OVAL Results document. It is possible for masking conflicts to occur where one entity has mask set to true and another entity has mask set to false.

As another example, if a state entity 'size' with an operation of 'less than' references a variable that has five different integer values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then the 'size' state entity evaluates to true only if the corresponding 'size' item entity is less than each of the five integers defined by the variable. If a variable does not have any value value when referenced by an OVAL Object the object should be considered to not exist. If a variable does not have any value when referenced by an OVAL State an error should be reported during OVAL analysis.

In this condition, there is no value of var_check which enables an element-wise comparison, and so there is no way to determine whether the two entities are truly 'equal' in that sense.

As another example, if a state entity 'size' with an operation of 'less than' references a variable that has five different integer values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then the 'size' state entity evaluates to true only if the corresponding 'size' item entity is less than each of the five integers defined by the variable. If a variable does not have any value value when referenced by an OVAL Object the object should be considered to not exist. If a variable does not have any value when referenced by an OVAL State an error should be reported during OVAL analysis. When an OVAL State uses a var_ref, if both the state entity and a corresponding item entity are collections of values, the var_check is applied to each value of the item entity individually, and all must evaluate to true for the state entity to evaluate to true. In this condition, there is no value of var_check which enables an element-wise comparison, and so there is no way to determine whether the two entities are truly 'equal' in that sense. If var_ref is present but var_check is not, the element should be processed as if var_check has the value "all".

For example, if an object entity 'filename' with an operation of 'not equal' references a variable that returns five different values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then an actual file on the system matches only if the actual filename does not equal any of the variable values. As another example, if a state entity 'size' with an operation of 'less than' references a variable that has five different integer values, and the var_check attribute has a value of 'all', then the 'size' state entity evaluates to true only if the corresponding 'size' item entity is less than each of the five integers defined by the variable. If a variable does not have any value value when referenced by an OVAL Object the object should be considered to not exist. If a variable does not have any value when referenced by an OVAL State an error should be reported during OVAL analysis. When an OVAL State uses a var_ref, if both the state entity and a corresponding item entity are collections of values, the var_check is applied to each value of the item entity individually, and all must evaluate to true for the state entity to evaluate to true. In this condition, there is no value of var_check which enables an element-wise comparison, and so there is no way to determine whether the two entities are truly 'equal' in that sense. If var_ref is present but var_check is not, the element should be processed as if var_check has the value "all".

	// Datatype: The optional datatype attribute specifies how the given operation should be applied to the data. Since we are dealing with XML everything is technically a string, but often the value is meant to represent some other datatype and this affects the way an operation is performed. For example, with the statement 'is 123 less than 98'. If the data is treated as integers the answer is no, but if the data is treated as strings, then the answer is yes. Specifying a datatype defines how the less than operation should be performed. Another way of thinking of things is that the datatype attribute specifies how the data should be cast before performing the operation (note that the default datatype is 'string'). In the previous example, if the datatype is set to int, then '123' and '98' should be cast as integers. Another example is applying the 'equals' operation to '1.0.0.0' and '1.0'. With datatype 'string' they are not equal, with datatype 'version' they are. Note that there are certain cases where a cast from one datatype to another is not possible. If a cast cannot be made, (trying to cast 'abc' to an integer) then an error should be reported. For example, if the datatype is set to 'integer' and the value is the empty string. There is no way to cast the empty string (or NULL) to an integer, and in cases like this an error should be reported.

This is used by the Result document which uses the System Characteristics schema to format the information found on a specific system.

Values MUST NOT be masked in OVAL System Characteristics documents that are not contained within an OVAL Results document. It is possible for masking conflicts to occur where one entity has mask set to true and another entity has mask set to false. A conflict will occur when the mask attribute is set differently on an OVAL Object and matching OVAL State or when more than one OVAL Objects identify the same OVAL Item(s). When such a conflict occurs the result is always to mask the entity.

If the variable being referenced does not have a value (for example, if the variable pertains to the size of a file, but the file does not exist) then one of two results are possible. If the element is part of an object declaration, then the object element referencing it is considered to not exist.
